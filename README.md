# PandemicBoardGame

Pandemic is a cooperative board game in which players work as a team to treat infections around the world while gathering resources for cures.
As skilled members of a disease-fighting team, you and the other players work together to keep the world safe from outbreaks and epidemics.
Only through teamwork will you have a chance to find a cure.
